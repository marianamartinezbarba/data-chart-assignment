<p>Pew studies from 2021 showed that only (65%) of Hispanics have a broadband connection compared to their white (80%) and black (71%) counterparts. This digital divide in the community is defined by three aspects: affordability, availability, and skills. As the Hispanic population continues to confront this inequity, I studied two zip codes (with the NYS Digital Equity Portal) representing the few predominantly Latino areas in Williamsburg. Upon speaking with Russell Weaver, expert who worked on the portal, he shared the significance of gathering this data. “We are seeing broadband is increasingly necessary for a household's economic wellbeing, for education and so many other facets of life.” The zip codes 11206 and 11211 both have significant broadband connectivity, and internet access. However, 10% of latinos in these zip codes combined don’t have a computer at home, which would be an interesting data point to further investigate. </p>
